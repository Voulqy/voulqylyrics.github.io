[Verse 1]<br>
Yeah, uh, yeah<br>
Livin' life like this<br>
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this<br>
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this<br>
Where they up to no good on a night like this<br>
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause<br>
Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was<br>
I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug<br>
Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug<br>
Now, born and raised in my area<br>
Beautiful by day, by night it's hysteria<br>
Fuck around and bury ya tonight<br>
Ridin' with my homies on sight<br>
Momma tell me to come in at night<br>
Now I really gotta go, but they never know<br>
Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow<br>
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib<br>
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib<br>
Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night<br>
Wakin' up, scared for my life<br>
Never had the heat, just a knife<br>
When the gat go blat like that<br>
Guarantee you it’s a wrap<br>
Finna put you on your back like that<br>
Just breathe, while their mama grieve<br>
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve<br>
Gotta leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis<br>
No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop<br>
‘Fore they even call the cops<br>
Do it for the money and the bitches<br>
And the drugs and the props<br>
Tell me why another body even gotta drop<br>
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related<br>
<br>

<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Livin' life like this<br>
Hope little Bobby never fight like this<br>
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this<br>
All about the money on a night like this<br>
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib<br>
Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance<br>
Never had the chance, yeah<br>
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out<br>
If you want it I'ma lay it out<br>
Hope my little brother make it out<br>
Every night what I pray about what I pray about<br>
Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way<br>
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away<br>
I imagine a better life<br>
Where I never had a debt in life<br>
Hit you with the *gunshots* in the dead of night<br>
Sellin' crack to my own pops<br>
Pushin' this weight on my own block<br>
If I sell a brick I can buy a house<br>
If they find the key they might lock me up<br>
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck<br>
Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck<br>
[Pause] — Get down or lay down<br>
Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down<br>
Stray shots on the playground<br>
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given<br>
Anybody that’s ridin' with me, I’m ridin' with 'em<br>
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em<br>
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em<br>
And hit 'em with the venom<br>
Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it<br>
I knew it, already been through it<br>
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life<br>
Anybody that's gang related<br>
